Hey there! Welcome to my first web development project.  While it's not a complete website, it's a cool step towards building something awesome. I've focused on creating a system where people can sign up, log in, and even recover their forgotten passwords using email magic (thanks to PHP Mailer).

Now, I'm no coding wizard, but I've taken my first shot at using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in good ol' PHP. ðŸ˜„

Here's the deal: I've made a special place for all the pages you'll need by putting them together on the main page. I've also set up a way for you to get back your forgotten password, and I've kept that neatly tucked away in its own special folder.

Ever seen those fancy websites that show errors in real-time? I've given it a try too! All those little messages that pop up when something goes wrong â€“ that's me using some clever tricks with cookies.

I've tried to be organized by giving each task its own special file. So, if you're curious about how the login stuff works, you can peek into the 'login_setup' file. Same goes for signing up. Makes things easier to find, you know?

And guess what? All those forms you fill out? They're all in one cozy place called the 'includes' folder. Whether it's signing up, logging in, or just moving around the website, you'll find them there.

Now, I'm no expert, but they say it's good to leave little notes for others (and yourself) in the code. So, I've sprinkled in some comments here and there. They're like sticky notes to help anyone who takes a look at my code.

I gotta admit, I've made my share of blunders, but that's all part of the learning process, right? Every mistake is a step forward. I'm working hard every day to get better at this stuff, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me.

So, whether you're a coding guru or just starting out like me, I hope you find something interesting here. Let's keep learning and building together!
